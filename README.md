This is code for a security system that I created for a CS 355 Systems Programming. It is written in C and uses twilio api to send a text alert to a given phone number. The system uses two sensors, one to detect a door being open or not, and the second is a button that turns the alarm on and off. With the alarm off, the door opening triggers music to play through speakers. If the door is open for too long, the alarm will sound and a text alert will be sent to notify you that the door was left open. With the alarm on, the door opening will trigger the alarm and a text alert notifying you that the door has been opened.
